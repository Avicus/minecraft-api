# minecraft-api

Shared interfaces for the SportBukkit and BungeeCord (OCN fork) APIs

These interfaces can be used to write hybrid code that works with both APIs.
Currently, the following things are implemented, roughly speaking:

  * Plugin information
  * Plugin configuration
  * Loggers
  * Online player list/search
  * Getting player name and locale
  * Sending component messages to players/console
  * Very basic permission checking
