# minecraft-api

Shared interfaces for the SportBukkit and BungeeCord (OCN fork) APIs

These interfaces can be used to write hybrid code that works with both APIs.
Currently, only a few things are implemented:

  * Checking permissions
  * Getting player name and locale
  * Sending messages to players/console
